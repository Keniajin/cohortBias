% \section{Supplementary Data}

% Supplementary Material should be uploaded separately on submission. Please include any supplementary data, figures and/or tables. 

% Supplementary material is not typeset so please ensure that all information is clearly presented, the appropriate caption is included in the file and not in the manuscript, and that the style conforms to the rest of the article. 

\section{Supplementary Figures}

% For more information on Supplementary Material and for details on the different file types accepted, please see  \href{http://home.frontiersin.org/about/author-guidelines#SupplementaryMaterial}{the Supplementary Material section}  of the Author Guidelines.


% \subsection{Figures}

%%% There is no need for adding the file termination, as long as you indicate where the file is saved. In the examples below the files (logo1.jpg and logos.jpg) are in the Frontiers LaTeX folder
%%% If using *.tif files convert them to .jpg or .png
%%%  NB logo1.jpg is required in the path in order to correctly compile front page header %%%

%%% If you are submitting a figure with subfigures please combine these into one image file with part labels integrated.
%%% If you don't add the figures in the LaTeX files, please upload them when submitting the article.
%%% Frontiers will add the figures at the end of the provisional pdf automatically
%%% The use of LaTeX coding to draw Diagrams/Figures/Structures should be avoided. They should be external callouts including graphics.
